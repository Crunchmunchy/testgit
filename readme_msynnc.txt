Each option has its own sub options, which are also listed below

Notes : To do list
	1) Get the download manager working. Find out a way how we can get a donwload link from a specified portion of a yaml file
	2) Searching mechanism shouldnt be absolute. Option should be showing nearest searches while one searches
	3) On upload, how do we specify the url of the file provided to the uploaded file?
	4) Deletion of any file needs to be sorted out. Who has access etc etc
